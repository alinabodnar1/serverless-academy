Wait for userâ€™s input
Ask what the user would like to see in the output - what operation to do with words and numbers, namely:

1 - Sort words alphabetically
2 - Show numbers from lesser to greater
3 - Show numbers from bigger to smaller
4 - Display words in ascending order by number of letters in the word
5 - Show only unique words
6 - Display only unique values from the set of words and numbers entered by the user
To exit the program, the user need to enter exit, otherwise the program will repeat itself again and again, asking for new data and suggesting sorting
